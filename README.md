# Inventory Server #

A common feature of online games is the 'inventory' which provides a list of all of the items 'owned' by an object. 

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for anyone interested in seeing a demostration of a medium sized [Pestful](http://tailoredshapes.com/blog/2013/04/21/pest/) project. It doubles as the backend for my forthcoming game. 

### How do I get set up? ###

* vagrant up - will give you a working mysql database
* mvn jetty:run - will give you a single instance of the app

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Where appropriate pull requests must be covered by tests
* Style: very strong preference for adherence to SOLID principles - no hacks
